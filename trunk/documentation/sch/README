This directory contains circuit schemas, created in a simple gEDA editor.

On some schemes there is a microcontroller with single device, attached to it.
This has been done, because drawing all devices on the same scheme would
overburden it. All the schemes shall be, of couse, combined when planning
a real device. 

There are some ATMega16L pins, not connected on any scheme to anything. 
These shall be left unconnected at all.
