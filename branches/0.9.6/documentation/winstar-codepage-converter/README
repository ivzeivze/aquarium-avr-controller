In this direcory exists a Python program, that generates C code for use in 
"locale.c" by keyboard-typed strings. 

A process of localising the device for some language would consist of:
1) coding letter-code links in the script;
2) fixing project locale system a bit;
3) typing-copypasting to locale.c new strings.
