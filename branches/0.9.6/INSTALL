After successfully compiling the project, one need to:
1) Set fuse bytes of ATMega microcontroller to valuses, shown at the beginning
of aquarium.c.
2) Upload firmware.

There are multiple ways of doing it. In my particular case, 'dapa' simple 
programmer and 'uisp' tool were used. 

'dapa' is simple enough to be created manually, it's schema can be found in 
documentation. The only problem with it is that it requires old-fashioned LPT 
port.
