Some physical issues described here.


== Cooling ==

Project specifications do not make assumptions, how a cooling device looks like. The device knows nothing but only that there is a relay: if it's turned on, the water will get cooler. 

In the particular case of experimental device, a chassis ventilator is used as such a device. It's efficiency is, of cause, not great. Experiment shows that it drops about 2 Celsius degrees when turned on.

== Heating ==

Heating is much simpler, because heating devices are generally simpler and are more available that specialised aquarium coolers. In my case, there is an ordinary aquarium heater used.

== Temperature measurement == 

When fed with power supply, not filtered well, DS1621 thermometer produces noisy measurements. In order to make the system resistant against such situations, averaging is performed before using temperature value to decide about temperature-controlling activities. As for version 0.9.4, the number of measurements to average is 32. It shall be noted, that noise amplitude decreases as N^(-1/2) upon increasing N, assuming that noise values are statistically independent.
