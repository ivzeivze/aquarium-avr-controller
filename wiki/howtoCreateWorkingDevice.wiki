#summary Creating a real device with the use of this project.

= Introduction =

This page is supposed to explain how one should use information, this project offers, to create a real device. 


= Look at how it has been done =

There exists a working instance of the device, created in year 2009. The device 
has been implemented in technics, described as "in solder this, connect with a wire to that, connect again, solder in that small thing, ...., find yourself in a pile of wires".

However, it works. The only trouble has been screening the sensetive digital part of the device from electromagnetic surges. Without proper protection, there have been problems with:
 * GSM mobile phone, sending data near
 * house refridgerator, starting to operate
 * Aquarium tube lamp, starting itself with a discharge
In that particular case, the problems seem to have been solved with shielding sensetive part of the device (everything, except relays and power supply) with 2-4 layers of household aluminium foil.

The photographs of the device can be seen in main repository.
